<div id="subsetting-in-1-dimention" class="section level1">
<h1>Subsetting in 1 Dimention</h1>
<p>Subsetting is simply the act of taking an object and extracting elements from it in some controlled manner. If the subset is assigned to a variable then it can be used just as the original object was. Here we will discuss subsetting in 1 and 2 dimentions (vectors and data frames). Although higher dimension objects do exist in R, the methods for 2 dimentional objects are easily generalizable.</p>
<pre><code>General form for subsetting in 1 dimention:
&lt;object&gt;[&lt;SubsettingCondition&gt;]</code></pre>
<pre class="r"><code># The vector we will be subsetting
x &lt;- c(1,1,2,3,5,8,13)

# Keep in mind that vectors cannot mix data types
# The code below creates a character vector; the numbers are coerced into characters
# x &lt;- c(1,2,3,&quot;a&quot;,&quot;b&quot;,&quot;c&quot;)</code></pre>
<div id="subsetting-by-indexing" class="section level2">
<h2>Subsetting by Indexing</h2>
<p>R, like other programming languages, assigns indexes to objects containing multiple elements. An index is simply a numerical reference, based on the elementâ€™s position in the order of the object, beginning at 1 for the first element and continuing sequentially until the last element. Subsetting by referencing these positions is perhaps the most straight forward method.</p>
<pre class="r"><code># Subsetting the first element from x
x[1]
## [1] 1

# Subsetting the second element from x
x[2]
## [1] 1

# Subsetting the 7th element from x
x[7]
## [1] 13

# Attempting to subset outside the range of the object (there is no 8th element in x) returns NA
x[8]
## [1] NA

# Subsetting elements 3 through 6 from x
x[3:6]
## [1] 2 3 5 8</code></pre>
