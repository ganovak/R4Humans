<h1>1 Dimensional Objects</h1>
<p>Subsetting is simply the act of taking an object and extracting elements from it in some controlled manner. If the subset is assigned to a variable then it can be used just as the original object was. Here we will discuss subsetting in 1 and 2 dimensions (vectors and data frames). Although higher dimension objects do exist in R, the methods for 2 dimensional objects are easily generalizable.</p>
<pre><code>General form for subsetting in 1 dimention:
&lt;object&gt;[&lt;SubsettingCondition&gt;]</code></pre>
<pre class="r"><code># The vector we will be subsetting
(x &lt;- c(1,1,2,3,5,8,13))
## [1]  1  1  2  3  5  8 13

# Keep in mind that vectors cannot mix data types
# The code below creates a character vector; the numbers are coerced into characters
# x &lt;- c(1,2,3,&quot;a&quot;,&quot;b&quot;,&quot;c&quot;)</code></pre>
<div id="subsetting-by-indexing" class="section level2">
<h2>Subsetting by Indexing</h2>
<p>R, like other programming languages, assigns indexes to objects containing multiple elements. An index is simply a numerical reference, based on the element’s position in the order of the object, beginning at 1 for the first element and continuing sequentially until the last element. Subsetting by referencing these positions is perhaps the most straight forward method.</p>
<pre class="r"><code># Subsetting the first element from x
x[1]
## [1] 1

# Subsetting the second element from x
x[2]
## [1] 1

# Subsetting the 7th element from x
x[7]
## [1] 13

# Attempting to subset outside the range of the object (there is no 8th element in x) returns NA
x[8]
## [1] NA

# Subsetting elements 3 through 6 from x
x[3:6]
## [1] 2 3 5 8

# Subsetting elements 1,3, and 6 from x
x[c(1,3,6)]
## [1] 1 2 8</code></pre>
</div>
<div id="subsetting-by-logical-condition" class="section level2">
<h2>Subsetting by Logical Condition</h2>
<p>Subsetting by logical condition means keeping only elements for which the condition is true. This is the more powerful form of subsetting.</p>
<pre class="r"><code># Reminder of the contents of x
x
## [1]  1  1  2  3  5  8 13

#### Simple Logic ####
# x subset to elements greater than 2

## [1]  3  5  8 13

# x subset to elements less than or equal to 5
x[x&lt;=5]
## [1] 1 1 2 3 5

# x subset to elements that equal 1
x[x==1]
## [1] 1 1

# x subset to elements that are not equal to 8

<h1>2 Dimensional Objects</h1>
<p>2 dimensional objects, the most common dimensions for data frames and lists, are often used in data analysis. Subsetting them is not all that different from 1 dimensional objects, but with more options.</p>

<h2>Subsetting by Indexing</h2>
<p>The only difference here is that you now have to subset in two directions. If you try to subset in one dimension, it will assume you are referencing a column. In terms of returns, you have 3 classes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Class A: A single element. Here, you’ve subsetted down to a single element to just this value is returned.</li>
<li>Class B: A 1 dimensional object. Here, you’ve subsetted down to a vector. This is a 1 dimensional object with all the same data type. A vector is returned.</li>
<li>Class C: A 2 dimensional object. Here, you’ve subsetted to a differently shaped table than you used to have. It returns a data frame. The one confusing thing here is that an object that would otherwise appear to be 1 dimensional will return as a data frame if the elements are of different data types (i.e. includes numbers and characters). Vectors require all elements to be of the same data type. Data frames require each column to contain the same data type but rows can vary (which is exactly how this happens).</li>
