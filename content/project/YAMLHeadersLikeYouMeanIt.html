<p>The YAML (YAML Ain’t Markup Language) header is the sections at the beginning of each <code>.Rmd</code> file that controls the configuration of the entire document. When a new <code>.Rmd</code> is created in RStudio, the defaul YAML looks like this, where the title, author, and output sections are filled based on the selections made in the dialog box.</p>

title: &quot;Title&quot;
author: &quot;Author&quot;
date: &quot;9/2/2019&quot;
output: html_document
---</code></pre>

<p>Note that when you select a new output format to knit to through the knit button in the interface, it is automatically added to the YAML header. For example, if I were to knit the previous document to pdf, the YAML would automagically read this. Listing additional output options doesn’t change the printed output of each output format.</p>
