<h1>The Defualt</h1>
<p>The YAML (YAML Ain’t Markup Language) header is the sections at the beginning of each <code>.Rmd</code> file that controls the configuration of the entire document. Here we will discuss the YAML options in PDF output. Note that there are additional arguments that can be used when other templates are defined.Those are a conversation for another time.</p>
<p>When a new <code>.Rmd</code> is created in RStudio, the default YAML looks like this, where the title, author, and output sections are filled based on the selections made in the dialog box.</p>
<pre><code>---
title: &quot;Title&quot;
author: &quot;Author&quot;
date: &quot;9/2/2019&quot;

</div>
<p>Note that when you select a new output format to knit to through the knit button in the interface, it is automatically added to the YAML header. For example, if I were to knit the previous document to html, the YAML would automagically read this. Listing additional output options doesn’t change the printed output of each output format.</p>

<div id="top-level-fields" class="section level1">
<h1>Top-Level Fields</h1>
<p>Top-level fields are defined for all output types. Without additional definition, a subtitle, multiple authors (they will be spaced appropriately; alternative syntax is <code>author: ["Author 1", "Author 2", "Author 3"]</code>), and an abstract.</p>
<pre><code>---
title: &quot;Title&quot;
subtitle: &quot;Subtitle&quot;
author: 
  - &quot;Author 1&quot;
  - &quot;Author 2&quot;
  - &quot;Author 3&quot;
date: &quot;Date&quot;
abstract: |
  Here you would put your abstract. This is a brief description of the basis of your work and its conclusions.
  
  It can have multiple paragraphs but they must be indented properly in the YAML.

<div id="table-of-contents" class="section level1">
<h1>Table of Contents</h1>
<p><em>Note: This is the part where you may start to use logical arguments in your YAML. In a YAML, <code>true</code>, <code>yes</code>, and <code>on</code> (and conversely <code>false</code>, <code>no</code>, and <code>off</code>) are equivalent and valid input for a logical argument. Additionally, quotation marks are not necessary for all alpha inputs but can be added to group things better.</em></p>
<p>When adding tables of contents, they pull from the Markdown section headers. The <code>toc_depth:</code> argument dictates which section depths are listed. In the example, this argument is set to 2, meaning headings 1 and 2 are displayed, but lower ones are not.</p>

## Heading 2: A Subsection

Eos idque prompta eu, graeci perfecto est ut. 

### Heading 3: A Subsubsection (if it&#39;s good enough for LaTeX, it&#39;s good enough for me)

<h1>Section Numbering</h1>
<p>By default, sections are not numbered. But if this argument is set to true, they are numbered sequentially. Lower-level sections are denoted by decimal points.</p>

<div id="latex-options" class="section level1">
<h1>LaTeX Options</h1>
<p>There is a whole bunch of LaTeX options you can specify in a YAML and demoing all of them here would be unproductive. So, I will just mention ones I have found particularly useful. That said, if you need something else or are bored (and have no other hobbies but YAML options), check out the further reading section at the bottom.</p>
<div id="using-latex-packages" class="section level2">
<h2>Using LaTeX Packages</h2>
<p>LaTeX has multitudes of extension packages that can be used to create any number of effects in the resulting documents. These may be useful to you. To see one example, check out <a href="https://r4humans.netlify.com/2019/10/13/changing-pdf-orientation/">this post about PDF orientation</a>. Another common package is amsmath, developed by the American Mathematical Society it includes a variety of symbols and equation formatting options not available in base LaTex. It’s documentation is <a href="http://texdoc.net/texmf-dist/doc/latex-dev/amsmath/amsldoc.pdf">here</a>.</p>

<div id="indentation" class="section level2">
<h2>Indentation</h2>
<p>The default LaTeX template used by RMarkdown when knitting to PDF puts spaces in between paragraph breaks. To use indentation instead, use</p>
<pre><code>output: pdf_document:
indent: true</code></pre>
</div>
<div id="adjusting-margins" class="section level2">
<h2>Adjusting Margins</h2>
<p>This is done with a geometry argument. For example:</p>
<pre><code>output: pdf_document:
geometry: margin = 1in</code></pre>
<p>This will alter the margins all the way around. It can be replaced with <code>margin_left</code>, <code>margin_right</code>, <code>margin_top</code>, and/or <code>margin_bottom</code> commands for finer control.</p>
</div>
<div id="adjusting-line-spacing" class="section level2">
<h2>Adjusting Line Spacing</h2>
<p>The example below produces double spacing.</p>
<pre><code>output: pdf_document:
linestretch: 2</code></pre>
</div>
<div id="font-options" class="section level2">
<h2>Font Options</h2>
<div id="font-size" class="section level3">
<h3>Font Size</h3>
<p>This is done easily enough with the <code>fontsize</code> argument which controls the size for the body text. Most classes allow 10, 11, or 12 point font.</p>
<pre><code>output: pdf_document:
fontsize: 10pt</code></pre>
</div>
<div id="font-using-latex-font-packages-one-of-many-methods" class="section level3">
<h3>Font (using LaTeX font packages: one of many methods)</h3>
<p>There are a vast number of ways to change the font in LaTeX documents, however, they tend to fall into two basic categories: using fonts installed on your computer and downloading fonts from LaTex packages. Here I will demo the latter since it tends to be the less complicated option for most applications. The default LaTeX font is Latin Modern, it is a basic serif font appropriate for most official reports and documents. However, should you need to change it a variety of alternatives are available. Do keep in mind, not all alternatives are suitable for math typesetting so if that is something you will need make sure to double check that it supports math characters. Go <a href="https://tug.org/FontCatalogue">here</a> to view an extensive catalog of LaTeX fonts. The site divides fonts into several categories and displays samples of each. Click on a font to view its full page. Each has a usage section which dictates the code to use to implement that font. For example, if I were to want my document printed in Computer Modern Typewriter Proportional, a font in the typewriter category, I would use the following YAML:</p>
<pre><code>---
title: &quot;Title&quot;
author: &quot;Author&quot;
output: 
  pdf_document:
header-includes:
- \renewcommand*\ttdefault{cmvtt}
- \renewcommand*\familydefault{\ttdefault}
- \usepackage[T1]{fontenc}

<div id="citations-and-figure-lists" class="section level1">
<h1>Citations and Figure Lists</h1>
<p>If you want to have LaTeX manage your citations or list figures/tables for you, this information is entered into the YAML. However, the how-to with that particular task is a bit hefty so unfortunately it will be saved for another day.</p>
