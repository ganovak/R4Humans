```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(collapse = TRUE, 
                      fig.height=5, 
                      fig.width=5,
                      message=F,
                      warning=F,
                      error=F,

The YAML (YAML Ain't Markup Language) header is the sections at the beginning of each `.Rmd` file that controls the configuration of the entire document. When a new `.Rmd` is created in RStudio, the defaul YAML looks like this, where the title, author, and output sections are filled based on the selections made in the dialog box. 

```

title: "Title"
author: "Author"
date: "9/2/2019"
output: html_document

```

title: "Title"
author: "Author"
date: "9/2/2019"
output: pdf_document
---
```

Note that when you select a new output format to knit to through the knit button in the interface, it is automatically added to the YAML header. For example, if I were to knit the previous document to pdf, the YAML would automagically read this. Listing additional output options doesn't change the printed output of each output format.

title: "Title"
author: "Author"

output:
  pdf_document: default
  html_document: default
