<p>PDFs knit in a portrait orientation by default. However, should you want to output a PDF in landscape mode, it has to be specified in the LaTeX arguments in the YAML header.</p>

<p>Sometimes, you have a report with graphics that would be better displayed in landscape mode but overall, youâ€™d like the document to be in standard portrait mode. To accomplish this, you will need to use the LaTeX package <code>pdflscape</code> and use the following code in your YAML header.</p>
<pre><code>---
title: &quot;Variable Orientation&quot;
subtitle: &quot;This demonstrates a variable orientation PDF output&quot;
output: 
  pdf_document:
header-includes:
- \usepackage{pdflscape}

<p>Anything you would like in portrait mode, encase in <code>\begin{landscape}</code> and <code>\end{landscape}</code> commands. Anything not between these two calls will be the default portrait mode.</p>
<p>** Example output can be found <a href="https://github.com/ganovak/R4Humans-AuxFiles/blob/master/ChangingPDFOrientation/VariableOrientation.pdf">here</a> **</p>
